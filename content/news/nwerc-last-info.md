The 2024 ICPC Northwestern Europe Regional Contest will take place this weekend, and we hope that you and your team are
prepared for this great event. Please check the pages for the [latest system information](/systems) and the
[schedule](/schedule).

We want to remind you of the following:

* The contest machines will be desktops. We do not allow you to replace the keyboard or mouse.
* During the contest, you are only allowed to use your Team Reference Document (TRD) as reference material. You may
  bring three identical copies of the document per team, clearly marked with the university and team name. For
  specifications on the TRD, please check [the online booklet](/booklet). Your TRD should be handed in at registration. It is not
  possible to print the TRD at the contest site.
* This year there will be no water bottle in the goody bag. We advise you to bring your own refillable water bottle. The
  water bottles can be filled at all water taps. The water from Dutch water taps can be drunk safely.
* We will not be providing perishable cups this year. You will receive a mug in your goody bag to use during the
  weekend. If you wish, you can also bring your own travel mug.
* Please be sure to bring everything you want to use during the contest, including mascots and snacks, on Saturday to
  the test session. You are not allowed to bring anything on Sunday, except unmodified liquid containers.

The program booklet will be online this year. It contains a lot of useful information about the contest and the
companies making this contest possible. You can read the booklet [here](/booklet).

We have made a special map for this contest with areas of interest in Delft. You can take a look at it
on [https://wisv.ch/map](/map). If you and/or your team want to register on-site on Saturday morning, please contact us if you
haven't done so already.

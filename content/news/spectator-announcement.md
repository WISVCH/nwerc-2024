There will be an online spectator contest again this year.
The main contest will start at 10:30 CET on Sunday (November 24th, 2024).
This is half an hour later than the start of the real contest.
The test session on Saturday will also be available for the online spectator contest.

You can register at https://spectator.nwerc.eu/ once the website is live, this will probably be on Friday.

Dear contestants, coaches and all other programming enthusiasts,
{.booklet-side-picture}

Welcome to NWERC 2024!
We are very excited to have you here and we are looking forward to this fun-filled weekend.
NWERC is hosted this year again in Delft at the Delft University of Technology.
We hope that you not only have an amazing time at the contest, but that you will also get to know Delft a little bit.

On this page, you can find information, besides of course our fantastic programming contest, about Delft, the contest location, jury, systems and schedule of this weekend.

The CHipCie, a committee consisting of 13 very driven (ex-)students from the study association Christiaan Huygens, has been working very hard to make this weekend possible! From systems to logistics of the whole contest, everyone has tried to make it the best experience possible.
But without the jury, this contest would not be possible. They did their absolute best to come up with the most interesting, challenging and fun problems for the contestants to solve!

We hope that you will have an amazing time this weekend!
Good luck with the contest, but most important of all: have fun!

On behalf of the CHipCie,<br>
Nadyne Aretz<br>
Contest Director NWERC 2024

## Welcome
Welcome to the city of technical expertise in the Netherlands: Delft!
Here, many technical institutions have settled themselves such as TNO, Deltares and QuTech, among many others.
Delft is a true student city with student life blooming in all corners of the city.
The city of Delft also holds a rich history and dates back from as early as 1246!

### Population
The university has some effects on the population in Delft.
Did you know that the ratio of male residents between 20 and 30 year old in Delft is about twice as high as the national average?
And for the age range 20–24 this is even as high as three times the national average!

### Associations
Student life is very rich in Delft.
Many students are part of a student association: social, sports, games, hobby associations.
There is certainly an association for every occasion!
All associations hold in common a social aspect of hosting fun events and bringing students closer together.
Even NWERC 2024 is organised by members of the study association W.I.S.V. 'Christiaan Huygens'!

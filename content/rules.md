In addition to the official ICPC regional Rules, the following local rules also apply:

## Team composition
A student may compete when eligible according to the [official ICPC regional rules](https://icpc.global/regionals/rules) summarized in the [2024-25 ICPC Regionals Eligibility Diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cFXF7ZKNP72ZZrq3yVIrREdk-snse1aX/view).

* A team consists of 3 eligible students.
* The educational institutions must be from one of the region's member countries. By special request, teams from other countries may be allowed to participate in this region, as stated in the ICPC Regional Rules.
* All teams who want to participate must be registered.


## Contest Materials
We follow the World Finals’ Rules, so a team is allowed to bring 3 copies of their Team Reference Document, but not allowed
to bring any additional reference materials such as books, program listings and notes! You may not bring any electronic device
or machine-readable media (this includes but is not limited to cell phones, **watches**, digital cameras, and mp3 players).
Teams are **not** allowed to replace the provided keyboard and mouse.
You may bring pens or pencils, but not paper (these will be provided).
Winter coats, bags, etc. should not be brought to the contest floor.

Each contestant may bring a copy of a Team Reference Document. This document may contain up to 25 pages of reference materials,
single-sided, letter or A4 size, with pages numbered in the upper right-hand corner and your university name printed in the upper
left-hand corner. Text and illustrations must be readable by a person with correctable eyesight without magnification from a
distance of ½ meter. It may include handwritten comments and corrections on the fronts of pages only. The document should be
in some type of notebook or folder with the name of your institution on the front.

Each team member may bring one printed, unannotated natural language dictionary. You may bring mascots such as stuffed
toy animals or party hats (provided they do not violate any of the above constraints). If there is some other item your
team needs at the contest, please contact the Head of Jury.

Team Reference Documents should be handed in at the registration.
Mascots, snacks, and other items (see above) can be brought to the team's table during the test session.
These items should be left on the table after the test session and will be checked before the contest on Sunday.
It is not allowed to bring anything with you to the contest floor on Sunday, with the exception of unmodified liquid containers
(e.g. mugs, cups, bottles).

## Conduct during contest
Please take note of the following addition to the ICPC Regional Rules:
>The ICPC is an extra-curricular, competitive programming sport of the universities of the world.    Good sportsmanship is a requirement.  At ICPC events, teams and coaches should not wear or bring anything that might distract from spotlighting any other team.  At the competition and ceremonies that require official ICPC Shirts, do not bring anything with you other than smiles, goodwill, and teammates.  Each regional contest director is empowered to add additional restrictions and to correct inappropriate behavior.

Please note that during the opening ceremony, test session, the contest and the award ceremony require the provided official NWERC 2024 shirts to be worn visibly on top. Badges should be worn at all time during the event.
